# Installing Debian on your Kindle

## Update 2022: This project live again, I updated the image creation script to use an archive repository to make it work on Kindle 3 WiFi (with Keyboard).

Have fun!

Update (2020): This project is deprecated. I have no idea if any of the following instructions are still accurate, or if any of the links are still working. I have now moved over to [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/kathamer).


## Installing Debian on your Kindle

The first thing you need to do is jailbreak your Kindle. The jailbreaking process involves allowing the
installation of unsigned applications to your Kindle. I used [this guide from LifeHacker.com](https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2016/07/how-to-jailbreak-your-kindle/)


Once you have jailbroken, you will be able to install a terminal.
Installing a terminal allows you to access the underlying Linux system on your Kindle. For this hack, I used KTerm. You can get KTerm from [here.](https://github.com/bfabiszewski/kterm/releases/download/v2.3/kterm-kindle-2.3.zip) To install it, you have to unzip the ZIP file you downloaded into the `extensions` folder on your Kindle's root directory from a computer.

Now that you have a terminal, you will be able to install the Debian chroot. 
Here's where it gets complicated. First, you need to generate a Debian image appropriate for your device. 
Use `MakeImage.sh` to do this. Run the script on a Linux system to generate the image. If you do not have access to a Linux system, message me and I can provide a pre-generated one.

Now, move the `debian.ext3` file on to your Kindle's root directory. You're almost there.
Once you have moved `debian.ext3`, you need to move the `RunDebian.sh` script and the `UpdateInitScript.sh` script as well as `RunBeforeDebian.sh`

on to your Kindle. Now you can run them. Do this by typing 
`cd ../..` and then `./RunDebian.sh --root` on your Kindle. You are now root on your Kindle!

Then, hit `CTRL-D` on your Kindle until you see `[US]$` or `[US]#` 
you are now back in your Kindle's terminal. Type `./RunBeforeDebian.sh` on your Kindle to setup mountpoints and install the `debian` command. 
Now, you should be able to type `debian` in the Kindle's terminal to access Debian. 
If you need root access (to install sudo, add users, etc) type `debian --root` to start Debian as root. 

You should now have a working Debian install. 

Finally, you need to setup Debian (IF YOU HAVE A PREGENERATED IMAGE YOU CAN SKIP THIS STEP)
First, type `debian --root` to enter Debian as root.
Then, type `cd /deboostrap`.
Next, type `./deboostrap --second-stage` and let that do it's thing.
If it fails, hit `CTRL-D` until you see `[US]$` then type `debian  --root` again.
Once that completes, type `dpkg --configure -a`.
Now type `adduser <USERNAME>` replacing `<USERNAME>` with your name.
Next, type `apt-get install sudo`.
Then, type `adduser <USERNAME> sudo` replacing `<USERNAME>` with your name and follow the prompts.
Finally, hit `CTRL-D` until you see `[US]$` and type `debian`.
Login with your username and password.
Finally, type `echo alias "sudo"="sudo -S"`.

-Enjoy!
